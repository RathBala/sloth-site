## Before writing any code

1. State how you will verify that this change works (test, bash command, browser check etc)
2. Write the test(s) for verification first - UNLESS it's a script. Do NOT write scripts i.e. skip to code if you're thinking scripts.

## Verification - required

- After any code change, run the fastest relevant verification command
- If verification fails, read the output, fix the root cause, and rerun until it passes
- In your final message, report exactly what you ran and whether it passed

## Commands

- Install: yarn install
- Lint: yarn lint
- Typecheck: yarn typecheck
